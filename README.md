A project to host EnPAC model-checker. (TODO : describe)
 
This project builds binaries for linux, Windows and OSX using public providers : [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/).  These binary targets are provided for convenience, in the hope that they may prove useful.

The resulting binaries can be downloaded from this page : [Binary builds](https://tj-cong.github.io/enPAC-2020/)
